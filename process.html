			<h2> Assignment 1 Description </h2>
		<br/>	
			<p> What ideas could you come up with if you weren't limited to the list of tools that you can download or purchase from corporations like Adobe and individuals providing open source software?
			<br/> In this exercise, you will draw a self portrait in Processing, and in the process, learn the fundamentals concepts of programming.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
			<h3> Process/Tools | Inspiration | Concept </h3>
		<br/>
			<p> After viewing previous students' work, I decided I didn't want something geometrically simple. Although some of the simple portraits looked cute, it also looked unimpressive. I wasn't going to aim for symmetry, and I didn't want simple shapes.
			<br/>
			So what did this result in?
			</p>
			<p>
			Using a Processing engine, I wrote lines of code. With the exception of two ellipse eyes and an obsecure triangle, the entirety of my portrait was made with unorthodox shapes.

		<h2> Assignment 2 Description </h2>
		<br/>
			<p> Using variables and conditional statements (if, else) to draw a sketch that interacts with the mouse. To do this, add Syntax: Setup and Draw. Conditional statements allow your computer to sometimes do things one way, and other times do them another way. </p>

			<h3> Process/Tools | Inspiration | Concept </h3>
		<br/>	
			<p> I wanted to do water ripples. Period. So I scourged the internet for some code. I tried creating my own in processing, by taking snippets of functions from various sources, but I didn't know coding well enough to make something do what I wanted it to. Luckily, I happened upon a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZUdGqeOD0w" target="_blank"> video </a> of someone recreating water ripples in a way as described in an old essay that no longer exists.</p>

		<h2> Assignment 3 Description </h2>
		<br/>
			<p> Building on skills you learned in the Processing exercises, create a p5.js sketch that you incorporate into your online portfolio. To do this, explore the 
			 <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5 website</a>,
			as well as the links below to Tutorials and Examples. Gravitate towards that which inspires you and modify it to make it your own unique creation.</p>

			<p>At first I was going to convert my modified bouncing ball into javascript, but that didn't work out very well, so I looked at the list of 
				<a href="https://p5js.org/examples/" target="_blank">p5 effects</a>
			 and picked one I thought was interesting and tried to make it look cooler.</p>
