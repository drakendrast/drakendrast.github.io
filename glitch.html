			<h2> Assignment Description </h2>
		<br/>	
			<p> For this assignment you will employ databending to instigate a glitch. You'll find an image to work with, make a copy of it, open it in an application that wasn't programmed to work with that file type, edit the file in that application, save it, open it in its default application, and be surprised. 
				<br/>
			Repeat a variation of this process at least one more time. Upload the original file and at least 2 glitched files along with a synopsis of your process.
			</p>

			<h3> Process/Tools | Inspiration | Concept </h3>
		<br/>
			<p> This assignment was more difficult than it looked. Despite the ease at which my classmates manipulated their images, my laptop refused to read or display the databent mess I created.
				<br/>
			It took some tweaking, but I finally cranked out some static. While my databending isn't as flashy, I'm quite over it, and was ready to move on.
