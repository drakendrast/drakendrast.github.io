			<h2> Assignment Description </h2>
		<br/>	
			<p>Tell a visual story without a narrator, voice over, or talking directly to the camera.</p>
			<p>Produce a video art piece using original time-based media. Explore ideas of camera placement, angles, speed, sequencing, editing, and visual effects. Find a unique perspective; explore ideas of how we see, and the vantage point from which we see, impact our interpretation of material. What kind of story do you want to tell: fact, fiction, an interpretation of a myth, etc.? Don't be afraid to keep it simple. 
				<br/> Edited videos should be 2â€“3 minutes in length. We will be using Adobe Premiere for editing. Equipment and techniques: You may use any device, from a cell phone camera (photos and/or video), laptop webcam, or a high end HD camcorder. You can create animations in Photoshop and edit them into your video.</p>
			<p>AKA : Tell a story with no words, record your own clips.</p>

			<h3> Process/Tools | Inspiration | Concept </h3>
		<br/>	
			<p>Upon hearing the words "original media," my budding idea of compiling a music video flew out the window.</p>
			<p>However, I am not defined by the anime music videos I love to make - I can dip my hand in the Slice-of-Life genre, too! My first idea was to cycle through clips of an average day, then replay it slightly desaturated, and missing some clips from the previous run. But a classmate had a similar idea, so taking the professor's advice, I focused on taking imagery from my morning routine, instead of trying to take in an entire day. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p> The narrative of my video emerged naturally.</p>
