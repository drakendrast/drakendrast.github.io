	<h3> Process/Tools | Inspiration | Concept </h3>
	<p> Using Photoshop, I complied multiple images into a scene. <br/> As a studio practice major, I don't have much experience working with Adobe applications. Photoshop was a new, and quite intimidating frontier for me. <br/> As a recovering game addict, I thought it would be fun to do an RPG parody of "conquering" / "beating" the boss monster that is Photoshop. </p>
