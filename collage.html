			<h3> Process/Tools | Inspiration | Concept </h3>
		<br/>
			<p> Using Photoshop, I complied multiple images into a scene. 
			<br/> As a Studio Practice major, my experience with the digital realm is rather lacking. Photoshop was a new, intimidating frontier for me. 
			<br/> Despite my lack of Adobe-savvy, I am a recovering game addict, and thought it would be fun to create an RPG parody of taking down the Boss-Level Monster I percieve Photoshop to be.
