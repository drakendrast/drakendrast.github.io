		<br/>
			<p> I'm not sure why I decided to create something large like a visual novel. Usually visual novels take a lot of work, effort, and time - all three things I can't afford to give during finals crunch. My vision went from 6 worlds, to one world, to... just reaching the basement.
			<br/> As a chronically indecisive person, I'm intensely familiar with the multitude of choices in real life. This game reflects my views on the power of "choice." </p>

	<br/> The furthest in the game you can travel to is to the basement floor.
	<br/> 
	<br/> [SideNote]: Although I'm not exactly what python is, I think python might be a better platform for this type of game/story than html/css.</p>
