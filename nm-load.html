	<!-- Location at the top? On the left? -->

	<!-- Img will be placed here. -->

	<!-- A text box. And some Text.  -->

	<p> This is the loading screen. It has a faded background, and a grid of boxes for save files. </p>

	
	<p> The grid is 3 x 4, and there are 8 pages availble for usage. </p>

	<p> There are buttons on the left hand side: Return, Save, Load, Quit to Menu, Quit Game, and maybe settings. </p>

	<p> The loading screen is actually a layer over the main game, so this page might not exist. </p>
